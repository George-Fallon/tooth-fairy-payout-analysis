# Tooth Fairy Payout Analysis
An Excel deep dive into Tooth Fairy economics ‚Äî payouts, inflation, and pocket money, and molars

## Project Overview

A fun, lighthearted Excel dashboard project that explores how generous the Tooth Fairy has been over time. Using made-up historical payout data, this analysis compares tooth payouts with average pocket money, adjusts for inflation, and tracks trends to see if the Tooth Fairy is keeping up with the economy.

## Key Metrics Calculated

-  Average Tooth Fairy Payout (1975‚Äì2024)
-  Inflation-adjusted payouts (2024 GBP)
-  Year-over-year payout change (%)
-  Longest streak of payout increases
-  Tooth value vs Pocket Money
-  Most generous year on record

##  Visualisations

All visuals were created using Excel's dashboarding tools (line graphs, bar charts, KPI cards, and more).  
The dashboard includes comparisons between:
- Tooth payout vs inflation
- Payout vs pocket money
- Tooth value over time

### üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- Add real-world data (e.g., survey stats, inflation from ONS or BoE)
- Automate inflation adjustment using a linked reference table
- Make the dashboard interactive with drop-down filters (e.g., by decade)
- Break out regional trends if additional data becomes available
- Try a remake of this project using Power BI or Tableau for comparison

### üí≠ My Thoughts

Overall, I'm really happy with how this project turned out ‚Äî and I had a lot of fun with it, especially given the quirky nature of the dataset. One of the strongest elements was the structure of the metrics and the creative comparisons ‚Äî particularly turning average pocket money into a benchmark for tooth value. I also feel good about my time management; I was able to plan, build, and wrap up the entire thing smoothly. If I had more data (like region, age group, or real economic indicators), this could have gone even further ‚Äî but for a fast, focused portfolio piece, I think it nails the brief.
