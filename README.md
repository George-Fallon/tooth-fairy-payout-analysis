# tooth-fairy-payout-analysis
An Excel deep dive into Tooth Fairy economics — payouts, inflation, and pocket money, and molars

## Project Overview

A fun, lighthearted Excel dashboard project that explores how generous the Tooth Fairy has been over time. Using made-up historical payout data, this analysis compares tooth payouts with average pocket money, adjusts for inflation, and tracks trends to see if the Tooth Fairy is keeping up with the economy.

## Key Metrics Calculated

-  Average Tooth Fairy Payout (1975–2024)
-  Inflation-adjusted payouts (2024 GBP)
-  Year-over-year payout change (%)
-  Longest streak of payout increases
-  Tooth value vs Pocket Money
-  Most generous year on record

##  Visualisations

All visuals were created using Excel's dashboarding tools (line graphs, bar charts, KPI cards, and more).  
The dashboard includes comparisons between:
- Tooth payout vs inflation
- Payout vs pocket money
- Tooth value over time
