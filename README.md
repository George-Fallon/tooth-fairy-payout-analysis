# Tooth Fairy Payout Analysis
An Excel deep dive into Tooth Fairy economics — payouts, inflation, and pocket money, and molars

## Project Overview

A fun, lighthearted Excel dashboard project that explores how generous the Tooth Fairy has been over time. Using made-up historical payout data, this analysis compares tooth payouts with average pocket money, adjusts for inflation, and tracks trends to see if the Tooth Fairy is keeping up with the economy.

## Key Metrics Calculated

-  Average Tooth Fairy Payout (1975–2024)
-  Inflation-adjusted payouts (2024 GBP)
-  Year-over-year payout change (%)
-  Longest streak of payout increases
-  Tooth value vs Pocket Money
-  Most generous year on record

##  Visualisations

All visuals were created using Excel's dashboarding tools (line graphs, bar charts, KPI cards, and more).  
The dashboard includes comparisons between:
- Tooth payout vs inflation
- Payout vs pocket money
- Tooth value over time

### Future Improvements

- Demographic Analysis: Add age, gender, or geographic data to understand how different student groups use AI.
- Time of Day Trends: Explore how AI usage changes across different hours of the day or days of the week.
- AI Prompt Analysis: If available, dive deeper into the content of prompts to classify by intent (e.g., brainstorming vs editing).
- Sentiment Scoring: Use NLP to analyze satisfaction comments (if present) and compare them with ratings.
- Compare First vs. Repeat Users: See how behavior changes between a student’s first AI session and subsequent ones.
- AI Assistance Impact: Create a more advanced model to quantify the impact of AI assistance levels on task outcomes.

### My Thoughts

Overall, I'm really happy with how this project turned out — and I had a lot of fun with it, especially given the quirky nature of the dataset. One of the strongest elements was the structure of the metrics and the creative comparisons — particularly turning average pocket money into a benchmark for tooth value. I also feel good about my time management; I was able to plan, build, and wrap up the entire thing smoothly. If I had more data (like region, age group, or real economic indicators), this could have gone even further — but for a fast, focused portfolio piece, I think it nails the brief.
